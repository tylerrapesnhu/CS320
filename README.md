#How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Ensuring that my work is functional and secure is a multiple step process. First we must make sure that we are creating programs based on the requirements we were given. After that, ensuring functionality through several testing techniques, such as static testic, code review, and unit testing.

#How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpreting user needs requires a balance of understanding what the ask actually is and if it can be created in a safe and meaningful way. You do not want to create a feature of a program that would result in a security risk, for instance. Also, sometimes a customer might ask you for a feature that would not actually solve the ask. Having a detailed understanding of the ask of the client is essential to creating a program that will be useful for the customer. 

#How do I approach designing software?
I design software by first addressing the requirements. In each case so far, those have been laid out for me. I then do some sort of pseudocode with general idea of how the program will need to be created. I then begin the actual coding. Throughout, I conduct static testing. I now have additionally started using unit testing.
